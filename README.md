# PageSpeed-Extension
Check the performance of the current page

This tool is a simple chrome extansion. Using this extension you will be able to easely check the score of the page opened in the current tab in Google's PageSpeed Insight.

## State of the extension
Right now the extension simply open in a new tab PageSpeed Insight and feed it with the url opened in the current tab. I have some goals for this app:
* [x] ~~Code a popup that shows in a minimal way the result of                    PageSpeed using Google's API~~
* [ ] Add some other online tools that will be opened in other tabs
* [ ] Re-design the options page

## Halp!
This is my first extension for chrome and I have never used the PageSpeed API. And I'm not even good at design websites. Basically i need help. If you can please fork this repo and help me with this extension. Thank you!
