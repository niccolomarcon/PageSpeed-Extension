# PageSpeed-Extension
Check the performance of the current page

This tool is a simple Chrome extension. By using this extension you will be able to easely check the Google's PageSpeed Insight's score of the page opened in the current tab.

## State of the extension
Right now the extension simply opens PageSpeed Insight in a new tab and feeds it with the url of the current tab. I have some goals for this app:
* [x] ~~Code a popup that shows in a minimal way the results~~
* [ ] Add some other online tools that will be opened in other tabs
* [ ] Re-design the options page

## Halp!
This is my first extension for Chrome and I've never used PageSpeed's API. I'm not even good in designing websites. Basically I need help, so if you can please fork this repo and help me with this extension. Thank you!
